    <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
    <!-- Content about your research philosophy -->
    <p>As you might be aware from my webpage, I work on mathematical and AI models to develop communication networks. This is somewhat at the intersection of ECE and CS. I enjoy learning new mathematical concepts and tools and use them to develop new algorithms. For research, I believe in having open technical discussions and often brainstorm ideas towards novel solutions.</p>

    <h2>To Prospective MS and PhD Scholars</h2>
    <!-- Content for prospective scholars -->
<!--     <p>If you are looking to pursue MS or PhD, I feel there are some important things that you should consider. In order to pursue research, it is important that you set your expectations right. This is not a coursework program where a degree is guaranteed after attaining certain credits. Before enrolling to any research oriented program, be clear of what is expected of you both from your supervisor as well as university requirements, if any. As supervisors, our responsibility is to support you to the best of our ability in this regard.</p> -->
    <p>If you are thinking of working with me, you are always welcome to contact me and start a conversation regarding your aspirations and plans. Since these are long term commitments, it is better to get to know each other. It would also benefit you to know someone you are choosing to work with.</p>
    <p>Wish you my best!</p>
